# Task 4: Fabrication

The two pictures shown below have the generated g-code (white/top) and sliced cylinder (grey/bottom). The first picture shows the top of the output, and the second shows the bottom. The sliced print was much faster and alternated infill directions, as well as having a more filled in top and bottom. The g-code print overall created the correct shape; however, the bottom layer had a portion of the outer rim missing as well as little extrusion towards the ends of the infill. This is presumably because the extrusion did not begin right away as the printer began moving. This example shows the g-code and slicer given by prusa slicers are more complex and account for more variables than the g-code generator we programmed; however, it proves the validity of the created g-code program.

# Task 1: Slicer
The parameters of printing are shown at the top of the image (extrusion width and layer height). This is manually input but can be routed back to the parameters in task 2.

Overall, my implementation of this task seems pretty standard (see pixelated screenshot below, full screenshot included at the end of the document). The only note which might have been different is that the contour seemed to begin at z = 0 and end before the top of the shape. To solve this, I moved the object up 0.01 mm.

# Task 2: G-code Generator

See screenshots of the code below. The E value calculation is shown first, then the generate function. For the full code, please see the documentation section.
