# Large 2: 3D Parametric Design and Slicing for Laser Cutting
### Task 1: Parametric 3D Designs 
Overall, this design mimicks a vase/bouquet?? which starts with a base, decrements to a circle, then expands to the same shaped top. (Really, I found the merge BRep option and got excited). The parameters are listed below. While there are more number sliders than listed in the table below, they are functional and cannot be changed.
|Parameter Name|Purpose|
|Circle Height|Changes the vertical location of the middle circle|
|Circle Radius|Changes the radius of the middle circle|
|Lower Square1 Dim|Changes the dimensions of one of the bottom squares|
|Lower Square2 Dim|Changes the dimensions of one of the bottom squares|
|Upper Square1 Dim|Changes the dimensions of one of the top squares|
|Upper Square2 Dim|Changes the dimensions of one of the top squares|
|Lower Square Rotation|Changes the rotation angle between the lower two squares|
|Upper Square Rotation|Changes the rotation angle between the upper two squares|
|Total Height|Changes the height distance between the two squares|
|Twist Angle|Changes the twist angle of the whole structure|

### Task 2: Creating a 3D-to-2D Slicer

All inputs are given in the top left corner -- design height, width (x), and material width (thickness). These inputs are then passed into division and series components to modulate the amount of slices. Each slice is moved to the bottom XY plane, then spread out along the x axis based on design width. Letters are added be deconstructing each slice and generating a line through (although this doesn't work with circular cutouts).

### Task 3: Exporting and Fabricating Your Design

Two designs were picked for fabrication with cardboard (2mm thickness). While the slices came out well, the twist did not translate as well as the slices removed some detail. While the difference between fabricated designs is hard to tell given the lack of detail, one design has a slightly lower and larger radius.
