### 1. Random distance/angle

Taking the branch structure used previously and reworking the code to be simpler (in order to show the impact of randomness), an angle and distance were modified each time F (forward) and left/right were called. The right angle was set slightly lower than the left to give the illusion of wind, and F was set within bounds to still create a usable design.

### 2. String Array

Using different characters to avoid overlap with the randomness assignment, a simple random string was pulled to generate the branching structures. Each rule was simplified to avoid chaos. Shown below are the n=4 results.

*I want to end this submission by stating that I decided to complete this assignment too late to have enough time for creativity. While my results fulfill the requirements, I know this program is much more powerful than the baseline designs I have used it for.
