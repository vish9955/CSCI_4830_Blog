### 3a. Trusscillator by R. Kovacs et al. - https://robertkovax.com/Trusscillator-a-System-for-Fabricating-Human-Scale-Human-Powered
Trusscillator is a program which allows for the fabrication of osscilating human powered structures. This program has a multitude of features, most of which revolve around using the limitations and guidelines of physics to adjust for a variety of factors (such as desired user size, range of motion, and more). While this program has many features, the optimization of springs is discussed briefly before the conclusion of the article. The authors cite that they use sampling-based optimization, first assuming all springs are equal and optimizing the spring constant of the one spring. Then, they increase the resolution to each spring individually, then repeat the process with a smaller range of spring constants. This occurs in conjunction with sampling with mass placed on various parts of the structure to increase stability. Below is an example of the fabrication process with the program:

This program interests me because I've been coaching gymnastics for 5 years, and am therefore constantly looking for new and intriguing ways to get children to experiment with movement.

### 3b. Representing Crochet with Stitch Meshes by R. Guo et al. - https://drive.google.com/file/d/144ngzg6L2j-bhTa1KJNqAM05w83pjl4o/view
This paper discusses the computationally modeling of crochet stitches with a "stitch mesh paradigm", where tiles, reperesenting groups of stitches, are generated to connect together and to edges, creating a product which can be molded based on design and stitch type. Various tiles were shaped and generated based on the geometry of a stitch, which could be then pieced together computationally. After the design of tiles and edges, this project was extended to 3 dimensions, where more complex and complete designs could be visualized. An example of a generated 3D crochet is shown below:

This project interests me because I recently picked up crocheting, and while I'm not sure if this program is necessary to teach crochet loops, it would certainly be useful to visualize the effect of various changes to patterns. In addition, it's interesting to see the patterns which I see every day broken down and analyzed so that it can be generated virtually.
